This project is designed to understand your thought process and problem-solving approach, which are crucial for our fast-paced, experimental culture. If you think this is unnecessary or excessive, don't apply.

Project Overview
We have a client who wants to create a system where they can query their past meta ads data through an integration, retrieve it and then augment it so the user can query it. This is a real challenge we've faced, and we want to see how you'd approach it. The use of AI-powered development tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf is hugely encouraged - we want to see how effectively you can leverage these tools to build solutions quickly.

Detailed Requirements
Build a simple RAG system that can:
- Connect to Meta Ads API (you can mock this for the demo if you don't have access to one)
- Allow users to ask questions about their ad performance in natural language
- Provide basic insights based on the data
Add one innovative feature that you think would benefit the client
