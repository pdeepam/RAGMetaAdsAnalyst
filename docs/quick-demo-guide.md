# Meta Ads RAG - Quick Demo Guide (3 Days)

> **Goal**: Prove RAG concept with minimal setup. Production-ready architecture is in [implementation-guide.md](./implementation-guide.md)

## Tech Stack (Demo-Optimized)

### Single-File Dependencies
```txt
# requirements.txt
streamlit==1.28.0
langchain==0.1.0
langchain-openai==0.0.2
langchain-community==0.0.13
chromadb==0.4.18
openai==1.6.0
pandas==2.1.0
plotly==5.17.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

### Why These Choices?
- **ChromaDB**: No external service, runs locally
- **Streamlit**: Instant UI with zero frontend code
- **Single file**: app.py contains everything
- **No FastAPI**: Direct integration, no API layer

import json
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# 1. Data Loading
@st.cache_data
def load_campaign_data():
    with open('data/campaigns.json', 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

# 2. RAG Setup  
@st.cache_resource
def setup_rag_chain():
    # Load and chunk data
    chunks = create_campaign_chunks(load_campaign_data())
    
    # Create vector store
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)
    
    # Create QA chain
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm=llm,
        retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# 3. Streamlit UI

    # Sidebar with sample queries
    st.sidebar.markdown("### Try These Queries:")
    sample_queries = [
        "Why did my CPM spike last week?",
        "Compare my retargeting campaigns",
        "Which audience performs best?",
        "Predict next week's performance",
        "Why are my conversions dropping?"
    ]
    
    # Chat interface
    if query := st.chat_input("Ask about your campaigns..."):
        with st.spinner("Analyzing campaigns..."):
            response = qa_chain.run(query)
            st.write(response)
            
            # Add visualization if relevant
            if "performance" in query.lower():
                show_performance_chart()

if __name__ == "__main__":

## Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Setup (30 seconds)
"Traditional Meta Ads analysis requires exporting CSVs, manual Excel work, and takes hours. Let me show you a better way..."

### Query 1: Anomaly Detection (60 seconds)
**Input**: "Why did my Black Friday campaign CPM spike 40% last week?"  
**Expected Output**: "Your CPM increased due to holiday competition in electronics category. Similar spike occurred November 2022 (+45%). Competitor analysis shows 12 new advertisers targeting identical audiences..."

### Query 2: Campaign Comparison (60 seconds)  
**Input**: "Compare my retargeting vs lookalike campaigns this month"  
**Expected Output**: "Retargeting campaigns: 4.2x ROAS, $0.28 CPC. Lookalike: 3.1x ROAS, $0.35 CPC. Retargeting wins by 35% due to higher intent audience..."

### Query 3: Optimization (60 seconds)
**Input**: "How can I improve my fashion campaign performance?"  
**Expected Output**: "Analysis shows audience fatigue (frequency 3.2x). Recommendations: 1) Refresh creative assets, 2) Expand age range 25-45, 3) Test Instagram Reels placement..."

### Query 4: Prediction (60 seconds)  
**Input**: "Predict my holiday campaign performance next week"  
**Expected Output**: "Based on 2022-2023 patterns, expect 25% impression increase, CPM spike to $12-15, maintain current ROAS. Recommend increasing budget by 20%..."

### Conclusion (30 seconds)
"What took 2+ hours in spreadsheets now takes 30 seconds. Questions?"

1. **Natural language queries** return relevant, specific answers
2. **Response time** under 3 seconds
3. **Historical context** included in explanations  
4. **Actionable recommendations** provided
5. **No crashes** during demo

### ‚úÖ Nice to Have
1. Charts automatically generated for performance queries
2. Confidence scores for predictions
3. Multiple follow-up queries work smoothly

### ‚ùå Don't Worry About

- Advanced error handling

---

## Post-Demo Evolution Path

### After Successful Demo
1. **Week 1**: Migrate to production architecture (FastAPI + React)
2. **Week 2**: Real Meta Ads API integration  
3. **Week 3**: Advanced predictive features
4. **Week 4**: Production deployment

### Or Keep It Simple
- Demo version might be sufficient for many use cases
- Can enhance Streamlit app with custom CSS
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud for easy sharing
