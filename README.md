## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Before**: Marketing teams spend hours analyzing spreadsheets to answer questions like "Why did my CPM spike?" or "Which audience performs better?"

**After**: Teams ask questions in natural language and get instant, data-backed answers with specific campaign insights and actionable recommendations.

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🧠 **Intelligent Query Processing**
- **9 Intent Types**: Performance anomalies, campaign comparisons, optimization advice, trend analysis
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically identifies campaigns, metrics, time periods, and audiences
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Different question types get specialized analysis approaches

### 🔍 **Advanced RAG Pipeline**
- **Semantic Search**: Understands meaning, not just keywords ("cost increase" finds CPM data)
- **Multi-Dimensional Chunking**: Campaign overviews, daily performance, insights, comparisons
- **Source Attribution**: Every insight linked to specific campaign data
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Professional vector database with persistence

### 💬 **Conversational Interface**
- **Chat-Based Analysis**: Ask questions like "Why did my fashion campaign underperform?"
- **Rich Dashboards**: Visual campaign overviews with key metrics
- **Sample Queries**: Pre-built questions to get started quickly
- **Real-Time Responses**: Instant insights with data sources

### 🎛️ **Production-Ready Architecture**
- **Dual Mode Support**: Mock mode (demo) + Production mode (OpenAI API)
- **Modular Design**: 8 specialized components with clear separation of concerns  
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error management
- **Caching**: Streamlit caching for optimal performance

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Demo Mode (No API Keys Required)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pdeepam/RAGMetaAdsDemo.git
cd RAGMetaAdsDemo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Production Mode (With OpenAI API)**
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run with full AI capabilities
streamlit run app.py
```

## 💡 **Example Interactions**

### **Performance Analysis**
```
👤 User: "Why did my CPM spike in the fashion campaign?"

🤖 Response: "CPM increased 25% due to audience saturation (frequency hit 3.2x). 
Recommend expanding audience or refreshing creative assets."
```

### **Campaign Comparison**
```
👤 User: "Compare retargeting vs lookalike ROAS"

🤖 Response: "Retargeting: 4.2x ROAS (Electronics) vs 2.1x (Fashion - saturated)
Lookalikes: Consistent 3.4x ROAS with 40% higher reach potential"
```

### **Strategic Recommendations**
```
👤 User: "What optimizations should I prioritize?"

🤖 Response: "1. Fashion: Switch 30% budget to lookalikes
2. Electronics: Scale successful video creative by 50%  
3. Implement frequency capping at 3.0x across campaigns"
```
